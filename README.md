# classif_tools

Collection of Matlab tools for performing classification, essentially using linear classifiers.

The included tools are:

* cross_validate: tool to perform cross_validation in a (relatively) simple way.

* sparse_svm: tools to train sparse regularized support vector machines. These tools were originally written by J. Frecon, J. Spilka,
N. Pustelnik and P. Abry, and were used in the following publications:
